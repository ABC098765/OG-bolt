# Conversation Summary - Cart Page Fixes

## Date: Current Session

### Issues Identified and Fixed:

1. **Cart Screen Calculation Errors**
   - **Problem**: Multiple calculation mistakes in checkout screen
   - **Status**: Requested more details from user

2. **UI Currency Symbol Issues**
   - **Problem**: Rupee signs (₹) needed to be removed from cart UI
   - **Solution**: Initially removed ₹ symbols, but this caused NaN errors
   - **Final Solution**: Restored ₹ symbols to prevent calculation errors

3. **NaN Error in Delivery Message**
   - **Problem**: "NaN" appearing in free delivery message
   - **Solution**: Added proper condition checks for subtotal < 1000

4. **Product Price Showing NaN**
   - **Problem**: Individual product prices showing as NaN in cart
   - **Solution**: Fixed by restoring proper price formatting with ₹ symbols

5. **Subtotal Showing 0 Rupees**
   - **Problem**: Cart subtotal displaying as ₹0 despite having products
   - **Solution**: Enhanced total calculation logic in CartContext with fallback to `unitPrice * quantity`

6. **Duplicate Rupee Signs**
   - **Problem**: Product prices showing "₹₹250/piece per piece" (double ₹ and redundant text)
   - **Solution**: Removed extra ₹ symbol from product price display

7. **Remove "per piece" Text**
   - **Problem**: Redundant "per piece" text in product price display
   - **Solution**: Cleaned up price display to show only the unit price
